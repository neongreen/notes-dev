# (wip) Restore on Win and ignore ownership

Useful if files come from another machine (and correspondingly have another user).

Open Terminal as admin. Then:

```powershell
resticprofile restore <snapshot> --target 'C:/Files/'
```

Then *not as admin*:

```powershell
takeown /R /F my-folder
icacls my-folder /T /Q /C /RESET
```
